# Subagents Required

Use subagents by default when tasks include documentation, deploy, verification, or repo discovery.

## Required usage
- **Doc Ops**: when logs/checklist/overview/status are needed
- **Deploy**: when pushing to production or running droplet steps
- **Test Runner**: when verification is required after deploy or UI changes
- **Code Explorer**: when scope is unclear or repo discovery is needed
- **Ops Auditor**: when SSL/DNS/Nginx issues are suspected
- **Content Migrator**: when extracting legacy content/assets
- **CI Monitor**: after pushes or when deploys stall

## Parallelism rule
If tasks split into docs + deploy + tests, launch subagents in parallel and wait for results.
