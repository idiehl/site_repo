# Subagent Usage

Use subagents to reduce latency for multi-step tasks:

- **Doc Ops**: prepare MCP payloads for logs/overview/checklist/status.
- **Deploy**: run push + droplet pull + build/restart checks.
- **Test Runner**: run smoke checks after deploys.
- **Code Explorer**: rapid repo search when scope is unclear.
- **Ops Auditor**: check DNS/SSL/Nginx health during incidents.
- **Content Migrator**: extract legacy HTML/assets into structured data.
- **CI Monitor**: review GitHub Actions status after pushes.

Default pattern:
1) Launch doc-ops in parallel with code changes.
2) Use deploy subagent for production updates.
3) Use test-runner if verification is required.
