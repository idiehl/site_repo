# Workflow Tiering

Classify each task before acting:

**Fast Path** (minor edits)
- Master Log only
- No deploy unless requested

**Standard Path** (normal feature/bug)
- Master Log + App Log
- Checklist/Overview only if changed
- Deploy if public-facing

**Full Path** (infra/backend/schema)
- Master Log + App Log + Checklist/Overview as needed
- STATUS PENDING → READY
- Deploy + verification required
