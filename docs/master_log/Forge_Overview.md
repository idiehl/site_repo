# Atlas Forge — Overview

## Concept
Atlas Forge is a UI design laboratory for exploring Vue and React component libraries,
assembling layouts visually, and exporting production-ready code.

## Long-Term Goals
- Unified component registry across major UI libraries.
- Visual canvas for layout composition with responsive previews.
- Code export for Vue, React, and HTML/Tailwind with design tokens.
- Collaboration and shared component libraries.

## Current State
- Astro-based app with Vue/React support and lazy-loaded libraries.
- Component browser, props editor, canvas builder, preview panel.
- Code export modal and saved designs (localStorage + API).

## Next Steps
- Improve canvas UX (snap, alignment, layers).
- Expand template library and starter layouts.
- Add design tokens and theme switching.
- Harden API persistence and sharing.
