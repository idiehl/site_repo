# Atlas Meridian — Overview

## Concept
Atlas Meridian is a next-generation desktop canvas for visual knowledge mapping, creative
systems, and media-rich editing. It focuses on spatial organization, linked nodes, and
an intuitive, fast canvas experience.

## Long-Term Goals
- Define a focused problem statement and target audience.
- Establish a clear workflow and unique differentiation.
- Ship a measurable MVP with a tight feedback loop.

## Current State
- Naming finalized (Atlas Meridian).
- Landing page and dev documentation are live.
- Desktop app scaffold created (Avalonia + .NET 8).
- Meridian API contracts added for project and sync workflows.

## Next Steps
- Finalize MVP feature list (links, nested nodes, editor core).
- Confirm desktop tech stack (Avalonia + Skia) and repo layout.
- Build first public prototype and feedback loop.
