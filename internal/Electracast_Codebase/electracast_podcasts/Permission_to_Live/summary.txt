Welcome to Permission to Live, with your host, cult survivor and certified life coach, Melissa Lyon West. Hear powerful stories of women who turned their midlife crises into a badass life.We’ll share the good, the bad, and the ugly that comes when you finally say yes to yourself, and why it is always worth it. These stories, from women just like you, are messy, honest and 100% unfiltered. We'll be dropping new episodes every Wednesday where we interview women who found the courage to take a big, scary step towards their dream, the things they would have done differently, and how it looks on the other side.
