Humanity has reached a crossroads. We have the power and resources to disrupt the status quo and create the future we want for ourselves and our communities. We are starting to see the rise of a regenerative future - the emergence of terra nova. People all over the world are waking up and ready to make real change. Our intention is to connect a global network of rule breakers dedicated to cultivating a better future. Our mission is to integrate ancient wisdom with today’s cutting-edge science and technology to solve the issues of today to create a better tomorrow. This community supports the regeneration of ourselves, our work, our communities, and our planet. We all have a role to play in ushering in this new world. Thank you for choosing to be here. Your unique gifts are needed for where we’re going. The Terra Nova podcast is a storytelling platform dedicated to exploring all facets of the human condition.
