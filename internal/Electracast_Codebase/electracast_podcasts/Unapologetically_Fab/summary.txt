Stefany Baclaan & Eden Alpert share perspectives on being UNAPOLOGETICALLY FAB, changing the narrative, leaning into who you are by creating and navigating a ‘LIFE BY DESIGN”, purposefully - designing each element of your world, from family, business and friends toward your definition of success. It doesn’t mean that your life is perfect, but it does mean that you’re living intentionally and with passion, knowing exactly where you want to go, and who you want to be - unapologetically.
