Psychic best friends and Hosts, Jason Zuk and Megan Kane invite you to delve into the supernatural and metaphysical worlds. Have you ever experienced deja-vu or thought about someone, and then they message or call you? Maybe you have walked into an old building, and get goosebumps or chills down your spine? Chances are, you're having spiritual experiences without even realizing it. To some, these signs are mere coincidences, but to those who have had a "spiritual awakening", we know there's more than meets the eye. The "paranormal" is normal, and subjects that were once considered "taboo" are a part of our every day lives. Join Megan and Jason, and their special featured guests as they discuss spirituality, life after death, energy healing, astral projection, psychic abilities, mediumship and more. Featuring Hollywood actors turned reiki healers, to every day people manifesting their wildest dreams and becoming household names. Meet Emmy Award-Winning masterminds, philosophers, and thought-leaders alike to the visionaries behind "The Secret."
