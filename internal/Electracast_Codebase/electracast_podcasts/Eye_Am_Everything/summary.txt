“Eye am Everything” is a reminder that we are limitless. We are not just one role, one experience, one identity, or one story. We are human, and to be human is to be infinite. We are always evolving, always learning, always growing.  We contain multitudes: strength and softness, struggle and growth, wisdom and play, dark and light. We are EVERYTHING.
