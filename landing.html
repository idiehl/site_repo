                    <p>This work is the product of a lifetime. None of the sections here have been the product of
                        individual investigation. Without the countless others who have contributed to the various
                        fields visited on this site, any rigorous inquiry into truth would have fallen flat. Whether
                        the contents of the site resemble reality in any useful way remains to be seen. Someone
                        else stated it simply: "If I have
                        seen far, it is because I have stood upon the shoulders of giants who came before me.".

                <div class= "sectionbody">
                    <p>Producing the site has come at a great cost. Without the support, compassion, and continued
                        understanding of others, neither time the nor energy to construct the site could have been
                        afforded. In conducting this investigation, an insurmountable debt has accumulated both
                        financially and personally. To realize a functional website has been dirty work. It has
                        however, not been erected in error. Like Jacob's Ladder to heaven, this foundation has been
                        laid in full sight of gods and men. Let these feeble columns stand as a monument to hope -
                        both personal and collective - for a future free of doubt, regret, and fear.

                <div class= "sectionbody">
                    <p>Some say life itself is a gift that comes at a price. Blood spilled is blood owed. It's true
                        that many cynics regard it as a curse. Without question, a compelling argument can be made
                        against the quality of our time spent here. Each day we face insurmountable odds. We endure
                        an apparently meaningless existence void of an overt purpose, direction, or structure. All
                        our castles will in time crumble to sand. No doubt, this fact is bitterly regrettable - that
                        we face the rising tide each day. All we love will wash away. It's enough to drive men mad.
                        God is cruel and vengeful in his retribution against us. Thus, we stand at an apparent
                        crossroads in our every step. Here we are confronted by an impossible dilemma. We've each
                        inherited some measure of intelligence and awareness of our surroundings. Some say the soul
                        is compelled to the service of goodness and compassion in understanding. If we accept that in
                        being we embody an inherent inclination toward goodness, should we strive to build up the
                        world around us in an effort to impose order on our surroundings? To work in
                        earnest toward a relief from human limitation can only begin in earnest from the recognition
                        of our own ignorance and folly. As we move through life, we leave a trail of blood in our
                        wake. As we encounter the world in all our righteous intention, we are drawn in every
                        direction toward injustice. Should we be drawn outward toward opportunity we move into a
                        carnival of horrors and violence. Men have, without fail, become lost in this wilderness in
                        their endeavors.

                </div>

                <div class= "sectionbody">
                    <p>Let the first truth presented here as wisdom in offering be this: If you trust in hope and set
                        out in search of disorder, that you might set it right, turn first inward toward you own
                        heart. Turn inwards and look back. If we should be so confident in our character as to impose
                        it upon the world around us, we must know ourselves fully in all our potential and folly. We
                        set out as wanderers in every direction. All around us we begin building up walls. Claiming
                        ownership and possession of everything under our dominion. We make alliances, form bonds, and
                        take vows. Insodoing we allow others to enter under our protection and authority. Men may in
                        time take wives. Bare children. All this and more we do in certainty of our goodness. If a
                        person should have any sense for reason, in establishing their domain they simultaneously
                        enter into conflict and disagreement. Being self-assured, we passionately defend ourselves
                        against hostility. Against our enemies. Against our peers. Against our friends. Against our
                        loved ones. Many turn to cruelty and vengeance toward others. Without much effort, we find
                        ourselves at war with everything around us in our quest for knowledge. They say war is hell.
                        Being in a state of hostility inspires hatred toward our enemies. Some become murderous
                        toward others. We may in desperation abandon the possibility for reconciliation - the bonds
                        between us are broken in anger. Men become monsters.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class= "sectionbody">
                    <p>How much disagreement can be explained simply as a difference in perspective? The first problem
                        of being is our individuality - our finitude. In all our wisdom, we still lack awareness. We
                        shed light on everything around us and all we can conceive of. However, the very fact of our
                        personal separation from others necessitates our fallibility and ignorance. Each of us stands
                        as an island. Forever cut off from the truth of those around us. Though we may agree on much,
                        even our nearest friends stand apart from us. Nothing may bridge this gap. In trust
                        and friendship we may grow in together partnership and closeness, sharing many qualities.
                        Those who stand apart from us, or against us however, grow apart in their experience. Without
                        much effort, we often find that people grow apart in time. While our domain may yet stand in
                        apparent harmony with justice, enemies gather all around us. In opposition with others we
                        share little. We know of our personal goodness and the quality of our experience, but we
                        regard others with deep distrust and suspicion under duress. When confronted with an apparent
                        contradiction between our personal observation and the experience of others, we cling tightly
                        to our own conviction. In doubt, we trust our eyes and our experience first. We'd sooner face
                        the possibility that humans possess the capacity for evil than consider our own lack of
                        knowledge. In fear, people tend to trust the fear they know.

                <div class= "sectionbody">
                    <p>Everyone has a unique response to conflict. Under duress, many would willingly submit
                        themselves to subjugation or subordination in favor of continued hostility with peers or
                        loved ones. Others are motivated by conflict and competition, so long as some semblance of
                        structure underlies conflict. However, in many cases people spend a substantial amount of
                        their lives engaged in quiet aggression against those around them - even those they claim to
                        love. For most of us, we find peace in the quiet of solitude and isolation. We may spend the
                        majority of our days in opposition with others - suspended in a kind of tense stalemate with
                        those around us. We negotiate our position through compromise. Interaction with some may call
                        upon us to resort to threat, intimidation, manipulation, and dishonesty. At the surface we
                        manage to occupy the same space without incident, but a silent war wages amongst us.

                <div class= "sectionbody">
                    <p>We often forget that all our struggle began with the basic assumption of our own integrity.
                        Some may spend a lifetime without turning away from the unending calamity that surrounds us
                        in our daily lives. Managing our daily affairs is intoxicating and hypnotic. Our every waking
                        moment is spent fixated on the drama as it unfolds. We lie awake at night, bewildered at the
                        terrifying possibilities all around us and the threat of what may happen next. The faith we
                        place in our own capacity to navigate our affairs is unflinching - we are utterly assured of
                        our ability to respond effectively to all life's challenges.

                    <p>To genuinely reflect on our behavior, or to consider fault in any substantial way for some,
                        rarely occurs. We may periodically submit ourselves to blame, guilt, punishment, and
                        embrassment when pressured to do so, or when we are certain of the outcome. But we are
                        reluctant to admit the possibility that we have been flawed in our core beliefs, or that we
                        are incapable of recognizing truth from falsity. Even moreso are we opposed to confessing
                        when our commitment to integrity is put under question. It's rare to meet a person who openly
                        admits to being a bad person - to being cruel, indifferent, selfish, or vindictive. Men
                        desperately cling to the image of themselves as virtuous when confronted. Even in error, our
                        underlying intentions must never be placed under serious scrutiny - for many, this alone may
                        provoke them to violence. The most important thing society offers an individual is the
                        opportunity to defend himself through communication under the protection of the state.

                <div class= "sectionbody">
                    <p>We're fortunate to live in a state where we manage to find relative success against the odds.
                        Culture has enabled billions of people to live together and work toward our individual
                        pursuits. It's possible to sustain the belief in our own personal goodness and to surround
                        ourselves with others who support this view. As long as we are willing to maintain a relative
                        similarity to those around us, to avoid friction and opposition, the illusion of belonging to
                        a community of people who share in the commitment to good is entirely sustainable. If we
                        follow the rules of society and play well with others, our community defends our quality and
                        the value of our experience. Moreover, the state has managed to execute justice against
                        criminality and deviance. If we are to trust appearances, then together we are realizing a
                        better world. In contributing to our society, we work toward a future free from conflict - we
                        believe wholly that our effort is not in vain and that we have realized victory and peace
                        through our commitment.

                    <p>Many are shocked when they experience tragedy for the first time. While intellectually we have
                        understood the possibility or inevitability of suffering and death, we seem to have the
                        ability to limit its influence on our emotions. In hope, we trust that through offering our
                        most passionate loyalty and labor in the service of good, it may not be in vain. Many adopt
                        the view that beyond appearance, the universe operates according to a perfect order. The hand
                        of God defends the truly devoted from the worst fate has to offer. The force exercising final
                        authority over fate, we suppose, must resemble us in our kindness and love. We may realize
                        freedom from fear altogether in the service of truth. All that's demanded of us is our faith,
                        worship, and obedience. If we manage to embody these qualities in life through learning
                        subjugation and service to God, all our faults will be forgiven. In exchange for our service,
                        we secure our position on the afterlife. The kingdom of heaven has already been realized. To
                        gain entry we need only submit to authority in life - God asserts that we may rest easily. We
                        need not spend life in toil, or concern ourselves about building a more positive future for
                        future generations. Life is but a dream. If we can only trust in hope, all the terror and
                        agony we feel toward death, pain, and judgement may be washed away and our lives may be spent
                        in relief.

                    <p>The church and other religious institutions have recognized for themselves the importance of
                        forgiveness. What they offer humanity is of immense value - few have considered the hidden
                        cost associated with the religious offering. Organized religion effectively acts as the
                        industrialization of virtue. As an organization they manufacture virtue in the form of good
                        deeds and charity. Every member may take credit for the works of the church - they may take
                        these offerings as evidence of their personal penance and reconciliation. Individuals in the
                        organization need only speak the vows, and observe its tenants to gain membership. Many who
                        fall upon hard times willingly utter the words in times of desperation. Their
                        directness is in itself a profound indication of their potent influence. We need only confess
                        our sins before God and man - to do so in truth and to ask forgiveness.

                        grace of god - and through grace alone. The great religions of this world have recognized the
                        truth of our condition. We are irrevocably and incurably flawed. Each of us is drowning in a
                        sea of illusion. It poisons us and all we touch. Men are sickened by it. No matter our
                        position, all our efforts turn to folly. The church provides men a way forward. To admit
                        one's foolishness and wickedness - to call out to the highest authority. To look out in every
                        direction and offer acknowledgement of one's error.

                <div class= "sectionbody">
                    <p>So far one truth has been here presented: To look first to oneself. The act of confession
                        resembles the insight in many ways and may possess similar value. Many of us have encountered
                        religious advocates throughout our lives who claim to have been redeemed and empowered
                        through God's grace. Some who align with the church are undoubtedly of great character, but
                        through experience we often come to realize an underlying hypocrisy in evangelists. While
                        they have themselves been gifted God's grace, they withhold it from others in their
                        interactions. Their most profaned offenses have been accounted for and forgiven, but many are
                        quick to judgement and condemnation. Forgiveness is a gift offered up to the few who can
                        afford it. The shortcoming of organized religion is that they reveal to us the greatest
                        insight - our personal fault, and in response they provide us with a means of forgiveness in
                        certainty. Thereby, men may indulge in sin without concern. Having committed egregious acts
                        against another, they presume to seek relief from guilt and shame without making an appeal to
                        the victim of their crimes. Their crimes have been paid for in full through the blood of
                        Christ. Men become gluttonous and bloated in their indulgence through the church. The most
                        horrific offenses have been acted out by men of the church - and paid through Christ's
                        sacrifice.

                <div class= "sectionbody">
                    <p>In times long forgotten to history, men weren't afforded the luxury provided by the church.
                        Before the establishment of statehood or kings on Earth, the world was a vast wilderness. No
                        safety or security had yet been realized through just governance. No law governed the affairs
                        of men in their transactions. The rule of the wild was the only dominion on Earth. Crime
                        committed was crime paid - often in blood. Doubtless, by today's standards many crimes were
                        committed unchecked. That is, only power defined authority and justice. Life itself was the
                        most valuable thing a person possessed. None had been afforded a line of credit. Men could
                        not spend what they did not possess. From the jungle, civilization emerged along with currency.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class= "sectionbody">
                    <p>The earliest religions realized the power of sacrificial offering as compensation. The brutal
                        wilderness separating men could be tamed through offerings of peace. In time, some began
                        accumulating wealth and abundance. Some learned that it was more profitable to spare the life
                        of another when they had something of value to offer. Governance and kingship came into being
                        quite naturally as wealthy men encountered those with little. Law emerged as kings realized
                        that men would willingly submit to servitude when faced with the decision of life or death.
                        The state of total war between men gradually transformed as all the world was brought to heel
                        in submission to authority. A new hierarchy appeared among the population - a distinct line
                        separating those who decree law and possess wealth from those who submit to slavery and
                        indebtedness.

                <div class= "sectionbody">
                    <p>We tend to hold contempt toward the system of hierarchy dividing us. While it's true,
                        historically it has been the cause of enormous conflict, we often fail to consider its value.
                        We're each born into the world as outsiders - in every way alien to the state. A threat to
                        the system in place. The state offers us terms for peace - terms for our unconditional
                        surrender: Obey the law or pay the cost. Refuse these terms and pay in blood. Under the
                        protection of the state we wield great power. So long as we observe the laws in place, no
                        crime against us goes unpunished. Words become more powerful than bullets - no harm may come
                        to us, no matter our position. We're free to accumulate wealth and exercise dominion over
                        others within the confines of the law.

                <div class= "sectionbody">
                    <p>At present, those born into this world have entered the stage at a late hour. Many have come
                        before us. We're born into hostile territory spanning this whole Earth. Nothing has been left
                        unclaimed - we have no alternative but to confront the powers that have here been
                        established. As autonomous individual we inherit a set of inalienable rights. The first of
                        those is to meet the state with hostility and open rebellion. We may accept the terms that have
                        been presented - our unconditional surrender in exchange for servitude. Or we may seek to
                        enter into negotiation with the powers that be in an effort to assert our individuality and
                        sovereignty. To set ourselves apart from the state, from God, and from any other individual
                        or collective seeking to enter into union. In each case we have been offered a truce. Without
                        question every other party we have encountered has met us with hostility - the nature of our
                        conflict disguises our wounds from us, but each of us bares the scars. Against God we have
                        endured the truth of death and fate - we suffer the nature of our human embodiment. Of our
                        limitation, fallibility, and vulnerability against men and in life. Our universe is
                        apparently isolated from the kingdom of heaven and falls outside its jurisdiction. The state
                        has surrounded us on all sides, claiming exclusive possession over the resources required to
                        sustain life. It has subjected us to impoverishment and scarcity. It has violated our
                        personal sovereignty and denied the right to privacy. It imposes the rule of law and the
                        threat of imprisonment. It has forced us into indoctrination and teaches us a means of
                        communication so that we may respond to propaganda. We must subscribe to the picture of the
                        world and of our surroundings that has been presented to us. A picture of war waiting just
                        outside our door. Finally we have endured humiliation as we have been forced to communicate
                        with our peers and participate in public education in such a way as to convincingly portray
                        our complete ideological indoctrination.

                <div class= "sectionbody">
                    <p>In opposition to God and the state, we have each encountered the "other" first and foremost.
                        First, we encounter the Mother - her love and willingness to sacrifice goes without question
                        as we each emerged from her womb. She nourishes us from her own bodily stores to sustain
                        life. Her authority is complete and goes without question. While in time through neglect or
                        abuse, our love may turn to bitterness as we grow into our individuality, any pain she may
                        cause through opposing our needs and wants is simply accepted without want of repayment. The
                        bond between mother and child presupposes an inherent trust and forgiveness.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class= "sectionbody">
                    <p>The bond between Father and child for some has a similar dynamic. Just as the infant
                        surrenders into nourishment and intimacy he has toward the Mother, the Father finds in the
                        son an opportunity to establish his own kingdom. Before the state, or any notion of God
                        enters the mind of a child, the Father embodies a first confrontation with authority. Just as
                        an individual is powerless alone against the state or God's hand, a child is helpless against
                        the Father. No crime against him goes unpunished. No personal insight may exceed his wisdom.
                        If the Father is good, as the child grows he is allowed to negotiate his position and develop
                        independence. To refuse this and instead rely on force, threat, and intimidation against the
                        child to retain one's position constitutes abuse. The good Father willingly shares in his
                        wisdom and support until the child no longer relies on it or wants it.
                    </p>

                <div class= "sectionbody">
                    <p>At every level, the individual must decide their response to the power dynamic occurring
                        between themselves and the other. Whether to defend their personal sovereignty or to become a
                        dependent. Our identity becomes a reflection of the nature of our relationships. Humans are
                        complex - we develop a distinct vocabulary in order to mediate each of our commitments. All
                        our effort goes into avoiding a deficit. To avoid debt and to work toward abundance and luxury.
